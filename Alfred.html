    <h1>THAT NIGHT</h1>
    <h2>By Alfred Ndwati</h2>
    <p>Meeting her was like stepping into a dream—surreal and unexpected, but unmistakably real. She stood a few feet away, wearing a dark-blue coat that clung to her in the cool breeze, its deep hue blending with the early evening shadows. She seemed unaware of anyone else, her focus entirely on the task before her. Her hands rested on the edge of a table, and before her lay a collection of papers and a worn notebook. She sighed softly, the sound barely audible but filled with a sense of quiet resignation.

        I couldn’t help but wonder what was on her mind. What could have her so lost in thought that she didn’t notice the world around her? Gathering my courage, I took a deep breath and walked toward her, my heart pounding louder with each step. Something about her, in that moment, felt different from the ordinary. Maybe it was the stillness that surrounded her or the way she carried herself—like someone who had the weight of many stories on her shoulders.
        
        <br>“Hi,” I said, my voice hesitant but filled with curiosity.
        
        She glanced up, startled at first, and then her eyes softened as they met mine. Her gaze was deep, a mixture of warmth and something unreadable, as if she was assessing whether I was someone she could trust with whatever was consuming her thoughts.
        
        <br>"Hi," she replied softly. Her voice was smooth, almost melodic, yet it carried a hint of exhaustion. She paused, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear, a simple gesture, but one that made her appear both vulnerable and composed at the same time.
        
        Now that I was standing closer, I could see the details in the notebook on the table. The edges were frayed, the pages worn, and the ink faded in places. Whatever it was, it wasn’t new. There were layers of meaning in that notebook, something important that had been carried and revisited many times.
        
        “What are you working on?” I asked, trying not to pry but unable to hide my curiosity. Her focus, the intensity with which she was staring at those pages, had drawn me in completely. I felt as though I had stumbled upon a puzzle, one I desperately wanted to understand.
        
        For a moment, she seemed to debate whether to answer. Her eyes flickered back to the papers in front of her, then returned to mine. “It’s... complicated,” she finally said, a slight, almost apologetic smile tugging at her lips.
        
        <br>I nodded, unsure how to respond. I had hoped for a clearer answer, but her response only intrigued me further. “Is it something you’ve been working on for a while?”
        
        She glanced at the notebook, her fingers brushing over its surface as if it held some kind of power. “Yeah,” she said, her voice quieter now. “It’s something I’ve been trying to figure out for a long time. Sometimes I think I’m getting closer, and other times…” Her voice trailed off.
        
        I stood there, feeling the weight of her words and the complexity behind them. There was something in her eyes, a quiet determination mixed with uncertainty, as if she was on the brink of a revelation, but not quite there.
        
        <br>“Maybe I can help,” I offered, though I wasn’t sure what I was offering to help with. I just knew I didn’t want to walk away without knowing more.
        
        She smiled again, this time a little more fully. “Maybe,” she said. "But some things are harder to explain than they seem."
        
        And in that moment, I realized I was standing on the edge of something deeper than I had anticipated, drawn into her world without even knowing what it held. But I wanted to find out.</p>
