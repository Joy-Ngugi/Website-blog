    <h1>HORIZON</h1>
    <h2>By Dennis Irungu</h2>
    <p>"Wow…" I sighed, gazing at the breathtaking view ahead of me. The sun was slowly setting, casting a golden hue over the rolling hills, the sky a canvas of orange, pink, and purple. The gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze and the distant sound of water flowing through a nearby stream made everything feel peaceful, almost surreal. How did God come up with such ideas of a beautiful creation?

        “What?” my girlfriend asked, breaking the silence. I hadn’t realized I had said that out loud.
        
       <br> I turned to look at her. She was standing beside me, her head slightly tilted, eyes curious but soft. Her brown hair caught the sunlight, making her look almost as radiant as the view we were admiring together. I smiled, feeling a little embarrassed. “Oh, nothing,” I said, trying to play it off. “Just…this. All of this. It’s amazing, isn’t it?”
        
        She chuckled lightly, moving closer to me and slipping her arm through mine. “Yeah, it is,” she said softly, her gaze returning to the horizon. “But it’s not just the view, you know. It’s moments like this.”
        
        I felt the warmth of her body next to mine, grounding me in the moment. <br>She was right. It wasn’t just the stunning landscape or the vibrant colors of the sunset; it was sharing it with her that made it special. I glanced at her again, taking in her peaceful expression, the way her lips curled into a small, contented smile. She looked like she belonged in this setting, as much a part of the beauty as the view itself.
        
        “You always have a way of turning moments into something more, don’t you?” I asked, half-joking but mostly sincere. She had that effect on me—transforming the ordinary into something extraordinary just by being there.
        
        <br>She laughed, nudging me playfully with her shoulder. “You’re the one getting all philosophical on me,” she teased. “I thought we were just here to enjoy the sunset.”
        
        I smiled, feeling a sense of warmth that had nothing to do with the fading sunlight. “I guess it’s hard not to get a little philosophical when you’re standing in front of something so beautiful.”
        
        She didn’t respond right away, and for a moment, we both stood there in comfortable silence, just soaking it all in. The world felt quiet, almost like it was holding its breath with us, waiting for the sun to dip below the horizon.
        
       <br> After a while, she spoke again, her voice softer, more thoughtful. “Do you ever wonder why we don’t do this more often? Just…stop, and take it all in?”
        
        I thought about that for a moment, realizing she had a point. Life had a way of pulling us in a thousand different directions, always pushing us forward without giving us the chance to pause and appreciate moments like this. “Yeah, I do,” I admitted. “I guess we just get so caught up in everything else, we forget how important it is to just…be.”
        
        She nodded, leaning her head on my shoulder. “Let’s try not to forget, okay?”
        
        <br>I wrapped my arm around her, pulling her closer. “Deal.”
        
        And as the last rays of sunlight disappeared behind the hills, leaving us in the soft glow of twilight, I felt a quiet sense of gratitude—for the view, for the moment, and for her.</p>
